This section shows you how to quickly code REST API integrations. Here you’ll find useful information about how to authenticate with the REST API and how to code common scenarios.

We provides many different code examples that demonstrate a variety of scenarios in each supported language (C#, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, and raw API calls using Bash and PowerShell).

###Application authentication
All applications that use the REST API must obtain an access token to authenticate their API calls before they can make any call to the REST API. You must submit this access token, which proves your app’s identity and authorization, with each request to the API. The code examples require an access token to function.
